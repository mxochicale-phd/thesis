\arguments{
\item{time.series}{The original time series.}

\item{technique}{The technique that we shall use to estimate the time lag 
(see the Details section). Allowed values are \emph{"acf"} and \emph{"ami"}.}

Available methods are \emph{"first.zero"}, \emph{"first.e.decay"} (default),
 \emph{"first.minimum"} and \emph{"first.value"}.}

function must cross in order to select the time lag. It is used only with
 the "first.value" selection method.}

autocorrelation/AMI function is shown.}

\emph{mutualInformation}.}

\description{
Given a time series (time.series), an embedding dimension (m) and a 
time lag (timeLag), the \eqn{n^{th}} 
Takens' vector is defined as 
\deqn{T[n]=\{time.series[n], time.series[n+ timeLag],...time.series[n+m*timeLag]\}.}
This function estimates an appropiate time lag by using the autocorrelation 
function or the average mutual information .
}
\details{
A basic criteria for estimating a proper time lag is based on the following 
reasoning: if the time lag used to build the Takens' vectors is too small,
the coordinates will be too highly temporally correlated and the embedding
will tend to cluster around the diagonal in the phase space. If the time lag
is chosen too large, the resulting coordinates may be almost uncorrelated and
the resulting embedding will be very complicated. Thus, the autocorrelation 
function can be used for  estimating an appropiate time lag of a time series. 
However, it must be noted that the autocorrelation is a linear statistic,
and thus it does not take into account nonlinear dynamical correlations. To 
take into account nonlinear correlations the average mutual information (AMI)
can be used. Independently of the technique used to compute the correlation, 
the time lag can be selected in a variety of ways:   
\itemize{
   \item Select the time lag where the autocorrelation/AMI function decays to 0 
   (\emph{first.zero} selection method). This
   method is not appropriate for the AMI function, since it only takes 
   positive values.
   \item Select the time lag where the autocorrelation/AMI function decays to 
   1/e of its value at zero (\emph{first.e.decay} selection method).
   \item Select the time lag where the autocorrelation/AMI function reaches 
   its first minimum (\emph{first.minimum} selection method).
   \item Select the time lag where the autocorrelation/AMI function decays to
    the value specified by the user (\emph{first.value} selection method and 
    \emph{value} parameter).
}
}
\note{
If the autocorrelation/AMI function does not cross the specifiged value, 
an error is thrown. This may be solved by increasing the \emph{lag.max} or 
selecting a higher value to which the autocorrelation/AMI function may decay.
