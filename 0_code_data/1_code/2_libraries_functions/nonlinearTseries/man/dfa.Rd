\description{
Functions for performing Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), a widely used
technique for detecting long range correlations in time series. These 
functions are able to estimate several scaling exponents from the time series 
being analyzed. 
These scaling exponents  characterize short or long-term fluctuations, 
depending of the range used for regression (see  details).
}
\details{
The Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) has become a widely used
technique for detecting long range correlations in time series. The DFA 
procedure may be summarized as follows:
\enumerate{
 \item Integrate the time series to be analyzed. The time series resulting 
 from the  integration will be referred to as the profile.
 \item Divide the profile into N non-overlapping segments.
 \item  Calculate the local trend for each of the segments using least-square
 regression. Compute the total error for each ofi the segments.
 \item Compute the average of the total error over all segments and take its 
 root square. By repeating the previous steps for several segment sizes 
 (let's denote it by t), we obtain the so-called Fluctuation function 
 \eqn{F(t)}.
 \item  If the data presents long-range power law correlations:  
 \eqn{F(t) \sim t^\alpha}{F(t) proportional t^alpha} and we may estimate 
 using regression.
 \item  Usually, when plotting 
 \eqn{\log(F(t))\;Vs\;log(t)}{log(F(t)) Vs log(t)} 
 we may distinguish two linear regions.
 By regressing them separately, we obtain two scaling exponents, 
 \emph{\eqn{\alpha_1}{alpha1}} (characterizing short-term fluctuations) and 
 \emph{\eqn{\alpha_2}{alpha2}} (characterizing long-term fluctuations). 
}
Steps 1-4 are performed using the \emph{dfa} function. In order to obtain a 
estimate of some scaling exponent, the user must use the  \emph{estimate} 
function specifying the regression range (window sizes used to detrend the 
series).
