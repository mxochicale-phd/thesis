\usage{
rqa(takens = NULL, time.series = NULL, embedding.dim = 2, time.lag = 1,
  radius, lmin = 2, vmin = 2, distanceToBorder = 2, save.RM = TRUE,
  do.plot = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{takens}{Instead of specifying the \emph{time.series}, 
the \emph{embedding.dim} and the \emph{time.lag}, the user may specify 
directly the Takens' vectors.}

\item{time.series}{The original time series from which the phase-space 
reconstruction is performed.}

\item{embedding.dim}{Integer denoting the dimension in which we shall 
embed the \emph{time.series}.}

\item{time.lag}{Integer denoting the number of time steps that will be use 
to construct the  Takens' vectors.}

\item{radius}{Maximum distance between two phase-space points to be 
considered a recurrence.}

\item{lmin}{Minimal length of a diagonal line to be considered in the RQA. 
Default \emph{lmin} = 2.}

\item{vmin}{Minimal length of a vertical line to be considered in the RQA. 
Default \emph{vmin} = 2.}

\item{distanceToBorder}{In order to avoid border effects, the 
\emph{distanceToBorder} points near the border of the recurrence matrix 
are ignored when computing the RQA parameters. Default, 
\emph{distanceToBorder} = 2.}

\item{save.RM}{Logical value. If TRUE, the recurrence matrix is stored as a 
sparse matrix. Note that computing the recurrences in matrix form can be 
computationally expensive.}

\item{do.plot}{Logical. If TRUE, the recurrence plot is shown. However, 
plotting the recurrence matrix is computationally expensive. Use with 
caution.}

\item{...}{Additional plotting parameters.}
}
\value{
A \emph{rqa}  object that consist of a list with the most important 
RQA parameters:
\itemize{
 \item \emph{recurrence.matrix}: A sparse symmetric matrix containing the 
 recurrences of the phase space.
 \item \emph{REC}: Recurrence. Percentage of recurrence points in a 
 Recurrence Plot.
 \item \emph{DET}: Determinism. Percentage of recurrence points that form 
 diagonal lines.
 \item \emph{LAM}: Percentage of recurrent points that form vertical lines.
 \item \emph{RATIO}: Ratio between \emph{DET} and \emph{RR}.
 \item \emph{Lmax}: Length of the longest diagonal line.
 \item \emph{Lmean}: Mean length of the diagonal lines. The main diagonal is
  not taken into account.
 \item \emph{DIV}: Inverse of \emph{Lmax}.
 \item \emph{Vmax}: Longest vertical line.
 \item \emph{Vmean}: Average length of the vertical lines. This parameter is 
 also referred to as the Trapping time.
 \item \emph{ENTR}: Shannon entropy of the diagonal line lengths distribution
 \item \emph{TREND}: Trend of the number of recurrent points depending on the
  distance to the main diagonal
 \item \emph{diagonalHistogram}: Histogram of the length of the diagonals.
 \item \emph{recurrenceRate}: Number of recurrent points depending on the 
 distance to the main diagonal.

\description{
The Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) is an advanced technique for the 
nonlinear analysis that allows to quantify the number and duration of the 
recurrences in the phase space.
