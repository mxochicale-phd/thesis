Dear all:
 
Thank you to all those who attended the training course of plagiarism last week. 
After discussions with Prof. Mark Sterling (the Head of School) 
and Dr. Dilan Jayaweera (Academic Integrity Tutor), the following can be made:
 
Publishing your research work is an important aspect of your PhD 
and the School encourages you to publish in journals as well as conferences.
 
You can include your published work in your PhD thesis. 
However, citation of your published papers should be included in the references section 
of your thesis and referred to in the body of the thesis whenever 
any parts from these published papers are used in the thesis.

For papers with multiple authors, again they can be included in the thesis 
as long as there is an appropriate section at the start of 
the chapter acknowledging that the chapter 
is based on a multiple authored paper, and as long as 
the supervisors support this approach and are willing 
to go on record stating that the PhD student contributed 
in a meaningful way to the paper (and thus the chapter).
For your information, attached is the University code of 
practice on academic integrity. Also, this is a link to an alternative 
thesis format that you may want to consider if you have many publications https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/as/studentservices/graduateschool/documents/public/rsa/alternative-format-thesis-guidelines.pdf.
 
To use the alternative thesis format, you do not need to make any application, but you should discuss with your supervisor.”
 
I hope this helps but if you are in doubt, please ask your supervisor or come to see me.
 
 
Best Regards
