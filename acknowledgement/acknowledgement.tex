I would like to acknowledge to the Mexican National Council of Science and 
Technology (CONACyT) that funded my curiosity-driven research which 
allow me to quench this endless thirst for new knowledge during my 
PhD degree at The University of Birmingham, UK.
To Professor Chris Baber for supervising my scientific endeavours
and who wisely looses the leash in any of my explorations 
so as to take me back at the right time to write up this thesis.
To Professor Martin J Russell who, in the first year 
of my PhD, helped with his acute comments and critics to make a
better use of the language or mathematics.
To Mourad Oussalah who kindly dedicate his time to discuss 
my research interest and our collaboration which were published 
in three peer-reiview confereces.
I would also like to thank to Dr. Dolores Columba Perez Flores for
her valuable comments that help me to have a better insight on
nonlinear analyses, and to Constantino Antonio Garcia Martinez 
for developing the \texttt{nonlinearTseries} R package that was of 
significant help to accelerate the results of this thesis.
