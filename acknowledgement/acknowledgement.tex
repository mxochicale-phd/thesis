I would like to acknowledge to Mexican National Council of Science and Technology (CONACyT)

To my supervisor Chris Baber (CB) and my cosupervisor Martin J Russell (MR) 
who helped with their acute comments and critics to make a stronger contribution to 
knowledge.

I would also like to thank to Dr. Dolores Columba Perez Flores for her helpful 
comments to polish the use of the language of mathematics and to 
Constantino Antonio Garcia Martinez et al. for developing the nonlinearTseries R package 
that significantly help to accelerate the analysis of the nonlinear time series in this work.
