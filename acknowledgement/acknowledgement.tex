I would like to acknowledge to both
the Mexican National Council of Science and Technology and 
the University of Birmingham 
that funded my curiosity-driven PhD degree.
%its finantial help allow me to quench for a while 
%this endless thirst for new knowledge.
To Professor Chris Baber for supervising my scientific endeavours
and who wisely loosed the leash in any of my explorations 
so as to take me back at the right time to write up this thesis.
To Professor Martin J Russell who, in the first year 
of my PhD, helped with his acute comments and critics to make a
better use of the language of mathematics.
To Mourad Oussalah who kindly dedicate his time to discuss 
my research interests and our collaboration with 
three peer-reiview conference papers.
I would also like to thank to Dr. Dolores Columba Perez Flores for
her valuable comments that help me to have a better insight on
nonlinear analysis, and to Constantino Antonio Garcia Martinez 
for developing the \texttt{nonlinearTseries} R package that was of 
significant help to accelerate the results of this thesis.
Last but not least, many thanks to Patricia Herterich, 
from Library Services of the University of Birmingham, 
who helped me to find the first published phd dissertations 
in 1901 and e-thesis in 2011 which allow me to 
state that this thesis is the first Open Access
PhD thesis at the University of Birmingham.
