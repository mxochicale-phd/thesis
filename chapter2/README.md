* [ ] INVESTIGATE MORE ABOUT intra variablity inter varialiby for \subsection{Variability within and between persons}
```
%References that define movement variability as characteristic of 
%multiple level of movement organisation that occurs not only between 
%but also within individuals.
%Another problem is the variability between-subjects and between-days 
%that Sandlund2016 et al. which helped to conclude that MV can be 
%considered as a personal trait.
%%Such work aimed to have better understanding of motor 
%%coordination of complex activities, however we believe that 
%%better understanding can be made with nonlinear dynamics.

Extend the investigation of the hourglass model:
\cite{seifert2011} proposed an hourglass shape to model movement varialibyt of 
swimmers. The hourglass model has been tested using 
hierechical clustering analysis 
which has been used 
"to detect inter-individual differences of coordination patters in executin football shots"
Chow, Davids, Button, and Rein (2008)
or to explore differences of skill performance for basketball hook shoot
Rein, Button, Davids, and Summers (2010)

This has nothign to to do with movement varaiiablity, however,
investigated the source of neck pain is interesting

Movement variability has also been used  as an analysis of risk factors (
