\LaTeX .cls  files can be accessed system-wide when they are placed in the
<texmf>/ tex/ latex directory, where <texmf> is the root directory of the userâ€™s
\TeX installation.
On systems that have a local texmf tree (<texmflocal>), which
may be named ``texmf-local'' or ``localtexmf'', it may be advisable to install
packages in <texmflocal>, rather than <texmf> as the contents of the former,
unlike that of the latter, are preserved after the \LaTeX system is reinstalled
and/or upgraded.
