1) Make sure you meet the PhD requirements for your institution

2) Keep perspective (Think of your PhD thesis as an apprenticeship).

3) “Writing the introduction and conclusion together will help to tie up
the thesis together, so save it for the end.” (Ashish Jaiswal)

4 ) Use project management tools (like trello) which allows you to create
‘boards’ on which to pin all of your outstanding tasks, deadlines, and ideas

5) Address the unanswered questions
“There will always be unanswered questions – don’t try to ignore or, even worse,
obfuscate them. On the contrary, actively draw attention to them; identify them
in your conclusion as areas for further investigation. Your PhD viva will go
badly if you’ve attempted to disregard or evade the unresolved issues that your
thesis has inevitably opened up.”
Michael Perfect

6) Print draft to proof.
Repeatedly reprinting and editing draft thesis chapters has two very helpful functions.
Firstly, it takes your work off the screen and onto paper, which is usually easier
to proof. Secondly, it gives you a legitimate excuse to get away from your desk.”
James Brown,

7) Checking is important
“On days when your brain is too tired to write, check quotations, bibliography etc
 so you’re still making progress.” Julia Wright
8) Get feedback on the whole thesis
“We often get feedback on individual chapters but plan to get feedback from your
supervisor on the PhD as a whole to make sure it all hangs together nicely.”
Mel Rohse

9) Make sure you know when it will end
“Sometimes supervisors use optimistic words such as ‘You are nearly there!’
Ask them to be specific. Are you three months away, or do you have six months’
worth of work? Or is it just a month’s load?”
Rifat Mahbub

10) Prepare for the viva
“Don’t just focus on the thesis – the viva is very important too and examiners’
opinions can change following a successful viva. Remember that you are the expert
in your specific field, not the examiners, and ask your supervisor to arrange a
mock viva if practically possible.”
Christine Jones

11) Develop your own style
“Take into account everything your supervisor has said, attend to their suggestions
about revisions to your work but also be true to your own style of writing.
What I found constructive was paying attention to the work of novelists I enjoy
reading. It may seem that their style has nothing to do with your own field of
research, but this does not matter. You can still absorb something of how they
write and what makes it effective, compelling and believable.” Sarah Skyrme

13) Get a buddy
“Find a colleague, your partner, a friend who is willing to support you.
Share with them your milestones and goals, and agree to be accountable to them.
This doesn’t mean they get to hassle or nag you, it just means someone else
knows what you’re up to, and can help to check if your planning is
realistic and achievable.” Cassandra Steer

15) Look after yourself
“Go outside. Work outside if you can. Fresh air, trees and sunshine do wonders
for what’s left of your sanity.”
Helen Coverdale
