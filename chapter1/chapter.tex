\section{Background}
Human movement is a complex system which involves not only multiple
joints and limbs for a specific task in a determined environment
but also external information processed through with all of our available senses 
and our prior experiences, which all play a crucial role in the way each person moves.
Recent studies in human motion recognition have revealed the possibility to estimate
features from lower dimension signals to distinguish differences between 
styles of movement, such as pedalling \citep{Quintana-Duque2012, Quintana-Duque2016}, 
gait identification \citep{sama2013, frank2010} 
or pattern recognition of physiological signals (speech and heart pathologies or epilepsy) \citep{gomezgarcia2014}.

The lower dimension signals from biological signals are generally time series 
of one-dimension in $\mathbb{R}$ which commonly have 
high nonlinearity, complexity, and non-stationarity \citep{gomezgarcia2014, huffaker2017, caballero2014}.
Traditional methods, in time-domain or frequency-domain, 
tend to fail when detecting tiny modulations in frequency or phase \citep{marwan2011}.
This can mean that subtle signatures of each individual's movement could be missed.
However, methods of nonlinear time series analysis can quantify such 
human movement variability \citep{Quintana-Duque2012, Quintana-Duque2016, sama2013, 
frank2010, gomezgarcia2014, marwan2011, stergiou2011, packard1980}.
With this in mind, \cite{bradley2015} reviewed methods for
nonlinear time series analysis, such as the reconstructed state space (RSS) \citep{takens1981},
recurrence plots (RP) \citep{eckmann1987} and
recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) \citep{zbilut1992}, which are 
explained below.
Such methodologies are implemented using embedding parameters ($m$ and $\tau$).
However, the computation of embedding parameters is still an open problem
since there is no general technique to compute the embedding parameters 
because time series are system-dependent, meaning that these may only work 
for one purpose, e.g., prediction, and may not work well for other purposes
e.g., computing dynamical invariants \citep{bradley2015}.

In addition, the quality of the time series affects the reliability of the results
for nonlinear tools. For instance, methodologies to compute embedding parameters 
e.g., autocorrelation, mutual information, and nearest neighbour,
require data which are well sampled and with little noise \citep{garland2016} 
or need to have purely deterministic signals \citep{kantz2003}.
Similarly, methodologies such as RSS, RP and RQA can break down when 
datasets have different length, different values of accuracy and precision \citep{frank2010},
%(rounding errors due to finite precision of the measurement apparatus which include frequency acquisition \cite{frank2010}),
or data is contaminated with different or unknown sources of noise \citep{garland2016}.
It is surprising that despite these problems arising from the previous constraints 
with regard to the quality of data and the estimation of embedding parameters,
nonlinear dynamics have proven to be helpful to understand and characterise time series
in the context of human movement 
\citep{Quintana-Duque2012, Quintana-Duque2016, sama2013, frank2010,
gomezgarcia2014, marwan2011, stergiou2011, bradley2015}.

Another point to consider when analysing time series analysis using nonlinear dynamics
is the appropriate use of post-processing techniques such as 
interpolation, filtering or normalisation.
However, there is little research on the effects of post-processing techniques 
in the result interpretation for  RSSs, RPs and metrics of RQA.

%Also \cite{bradley2015} reviewed the use of Recurrence Plots (RP) and 
%Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA), both of which show the recurrences of a given $n$-dimensional system  
%in a two-dimensional map of black/white dots, which help 
%to have a more intuitive meaning of the time series.
%Probably, the most important results of \cite{iwanski1998} is that 
%RQA are quantitatively and qualitatively independent of embedding 
%dimension which was also experimentally verified.
%However, the estimation of embedding parameters and finding the right
%parameters to perform RQA is still an open problem.

\section{Movement Variability (MV)}
Variability is inherent within and between all biological systems \citep{newell1993}.
For instance, variability has been studied in electroencephalographic 
signals in human brains \citep{klonowski2007}, in physiological signals like the heart 
rate variability \citep{schumacher2004, acharya2006}, respiratory patterns of rats \citep{dhingra2011}, 
in speech variability where not only the linguistic aspect is investigated but 
factors like gender, age, social, state of health, emotional state are
strongly related to uniqueness of the speaker \citep{benzeghiba2007}
or even in odor responses based on cultural background and gender \citep{ferdenzi2013}.

Variability has also been well studied in human body movement, where, for instance, 
\cite{bernstein1967} stated that no human movement is repeated exactly 
with the same trajectory.
With that in mind, movement variability has been used as a model of fatigue to prevent 
chronic musculoskeletal disorders \citep{mathiassen2006, srinivasan2012},
Movement variability has also been considered as an indicator of skilled performance
in sport science where, for instance, \cite{wagner2012} show how movement variability 
based on statistical analysis varies with skill for three levels of 
throwing techniques (low-skilled, skilled, and high-skilled).
%\cite{seifert2011} modelled movement variability using hierarchical clustering 
%analysis for competitive and recreational swimmers.
Therefore, \cite{bartlett2007} concluded that movement variability is ubiquitous across sports 
(javelin throwing, basketball shooting or running).
Another interesting example is that movement variability can be considered as a 
identifier for personal trait \citep{sandlund2017}, 
where many factors of the human body can be considered for identification, such as:
age \citep{kruger2013, macdonald2006, vaillancourt2003, stergiou2016},
gender \citep{svendsen2010},
pain status \citep{madeleine2008, sandlund2008},
body composition  \citep{chiari2002},
work experience \citep{madeleine2009},
pace, movement direction or cognitive demands  
like perception, memory or capacity of introspection \citep{srinivasan2012, kanai2011}.
Additionally, \cite{bartlett2007} highlighted that movement variability can be 
interpreted from different theoretical disciplines.
For instance, a cognitive control theorist considers variability as undesirable noise and 
variability is reduced as skill increases, meaning that 
"becoming dexterous freezes unwanted degrees of freedom in the kinematic chain" \citep[p. 238]{bartlett2007}.
In contrast, an ecological motor control specialist considers movement variability 
either as a functional role in human movement for "coordination change and flexibility to adapt" 
in different environments \citep[p. 238]{bartlett2007} or 
%movement variability is considered 
as an exploration and exploitation of body parts in the "perceptual-motor workspace" \citep{wu2014, herzfeld2014}.

With regard to the evaluation of healthiness, \cite{stergiou2011} highlighted that 
an optimal state of movement variability is associated with healthiness. 
Similarly, motor disabilities are associated with either wide range of behaviours 
such as random, unfocussed and unpredictable or narrow range of behaviours e.g, 
rigid, inflexible and predictable. For instance, postural sway variability was larger 
for patients with Parkinson disease or the likelihood of falling in elderly individuals 
were associated with too little or too much step width variability.
%Additionally, \cite{stergiou2011} reviewed works that quantify movement variability 
%in medicine, such as: variability of hearth rhythms with hearth attacks, 
%heart rate irregularities, cardiac death syndrome, blood pressure control, 
%brain ischemia, epileptic seizure,  among many others.


\subsection{Modelling Human Movement Variability}
The human body movement involves a complex system where many sensorimotor 
variables such as joints, muscles, nervous system, motor unit and cells are the sources 
for different types of variability \citep{newell1993}.
Hence, variability encompasses different types, sources and views of variability.
For instance, from a biomechanical view, motion variability can be modelled
as system of differential equations for the neuro-musculoskeletal 
control system where motion variations can occur because of 
"perturbations of initial states of the skeletal",
%for instance where right knee initial angles  can produce another type %of movement", 
perturbations of "muscular or neural subsystems ",
%where, for instance, initial conditions for certain muscles in the right leg can increase the "initial muscle activity"
or "external torques and forces acting on the skeletal system" 
%where for instance gust of wind might perturb the skeletal system.
\citep[p. 13]{hatze1986}.
%For which any injury, pain sensation  effect of fatigue are considered for 
%"variation of muscular parameters, perturbation of sensory neurons",
%and finally any changes int the motor program will create
%"variation of the motor program."
According to \cite{hatze1986} motion variability can be caused by 
(a) direct consequences of adaptive learning process, and 
(b) random fluctuations which are the result of stochastic processes in the
nervous system.
Hence, \cite{hatze1986} proposed measures of dispersion (e.g. Fourier series and 
entropy measures) to quantify the deviation of motion from a certain reference.
For which, \cite{hatze1986} pointed out that the combination 
of deviations from angular coordinates (radians) and linear coordinates (meters)
for Fourier series were unacceptable as the units are different.
Hence, \cite{hatze1986} proposed the use of entropy as a global quantifier 
for motion variability and concluded that any movement deviation on a body join 
may be the result of deterministic and stochastic causes.
%\cite{hatze1986} It is also important to note that experimental work of measuring
%running cycles, Hatzel1986 can quantify the variability between four
%cycles of running where the initial cycle has the largest (60m) 
%then it decreased and stay stable until (1600m) and then again
%increased at the final phase. 





Another approach to model variability has been proposed by \cite{muller2004},
who decompose variability into exploration of 
task tolerance($T$), noise reduction($N$), and covariation($C$).
\citealt[p. 229]{muller2004} considered that the quality of performance in 
goal-oriented tasks, 
e.g. hitting a target, is defined "by the accuracy and replicability of the 
results" (deviations from the target) "over repeated attempts of execution" 
(configuration of join angles with its velocity, angles and position). 
For the experiment, \cite{muller2004} considered an skittle task, 
where participants throwing a ball with a string that swings around 
a center post with the objective of knocking down the skittle at the opposite site.
Hence, \cite{muller2004} proposed $D$ as the absolute average of distance to
the targets in $n$ trials and it is used as a measure of the collective performance 
that combines a function for movements results based on the execution vector 
with a function for the minimum distance from the target $d$.
Therefore, the overall difference in performance $D$ is decomposed
into three unequal contributions of covariation $C$, 
noise reduction $N$ and task tolerance $T$.
Considering a 2-D task spaces that spanned the release angle $\alpha$
and absolute velocity $v$, the components of contributions of
variability were calculated from five data sets ($A$, $A_0$, $A_{shift}$, $B$ and $B_0$):
(i) the component of covariation where sets $A$ and $A_0$ and $B$ and $B_0$ 
have the same means and variances,
(ii) the component of tolerance where sets $A$ and $A_{shift}$ differ only on
their location in the task space, and 
(iii) the component of noise where sets $A_{shift}$ and $B_0$ have the same
means but different variances (see Fig.6 in \cite{muller2004} for further details).
With that in mind, \cite{muller2004} conducted an experiment with forty-two participants 
for five different locations of the target skittle where for each target a participant 
performed 320 trials which is a total of 1600 trials and therefore presented 
statistical confirmation of the contributions of $T$, $N$ and $C$ using ANOVA.
Hence, \cite{muller2004} concluded that $T$ and $N$ contribute more to improvement of a 
performance of a task than $C$ for initial practice, 
meaning that a new combination of angles and velocities explore a 
large region of solution space (hitting the target).
However, for later practice, $T$ diminished  and $N$ and $C$ started to 
be more relevant.
Also, \cite{muller2004} showed in various experiments of throwing actions
that variability in the movement results (deviations from the target) 
is generally smaller than variability in the execution
(variables or release angles and velocities) for which 
it is concluded that covariation between execution variables
is another component of variability.
With that in mind, \cite{muller2004} concluded that task space exploration 
is an essential  contribution to the improvement of movement performances
which is an explanation to the increase of noise in early practice phases.


\cite{seifert2011} investigated coordination profiles for recreational and 
competitive breaststroke swimmers and proposed an hourglass model of variability 
that illustrates the amount of variability as a function of expertise.
Hence, \citealt[p. 551]{seifert2011} stated 
recreational swimmers would show a considerable amount of intra-variability 
"as they seek an individually appropriate coordination pattern to accommodate
the novel constrains of locomotion in water", whereas experts swimmers, 
after a considerable practice,  
will still explore new environments to optimise their technique that 
create another secondary blooming of variability which is 
the result of "the environment exploration to optimise their technique 
with their individual strengths (e.g. physical, anatomical, mental, etc.)
and to gain an advantage over competitive swimmers".
To test the hourglass model of variability, 
\cite{seifert2011} considered the continuous relative phase (CRP) 
between the elbow phase angle and knee phase angle, therefore CRP 
is used as an indicator on how swimmers synchronise
arm recovery (elbow extension) and leg recovery (knee flexion).
Then, \cite{seifert2011} 
analysed inter-individual variability of swimmers with the shape of the curves 
of CRP which provide an indication of the inter-limb coordination, applied 
statistical measures such as hierarchical clustering using eleven variables of CRP 
to classify the recreational swimmers into three cluster of coordination 
(intermediate, most-variable and in-phase)
and used Fisher information to test which CRP variables were significantly 
differentiated the clusters. With that, \cite{seifert2011} concluded that 
inter-individual coordination variability for recreational swimmers could be 
the result of (i) different state of process learning, (ii) environmental 
constraints (different perception of the aquatic resistance), or (iii) 
different perception of the task constrains (floating instead of swimming).

Recently, \cite{preatoni2007, preatoni2010, preatoni2013} reported 
that inter-trial variability is defined as combination of functional changes 
associated with the nonlinear properties of the neuro-musculo-skeletal system ($V_{nl}$)
and random fluctuations in the neuro-motor-skeletal system ($V_e$).
Additionally, \citealt[p. 72]{preatoni2013} stated that the random fluctuations 
in movement variability can be composed by $V_{e}=V_{eb}+V_{ee}+V_{em}$,
where $V_{eb}$ is the "error in the sensory information and in the motor 
output commands",
$V_{ee}$ is the "changes in the environmental conditions" and 
$V_{em}$ is the "changes in measuring and data processing procedures".
Therefore, as similar as \cite{hatze1986}, \citealt[p. 77]{preatoni2013} 
pointed out that $V_{nl}$ "may be interpreted as the flexibility of the 
system to explore different strategies to find the most effective 
strategy among the many available".
%which is also investigated by \citep{wu2014, herzfeld2014}
Hence, \citealt[p. 1328]{preatoni2010} concluded that the total variability 
represent the changes of contributions for $V_e$ and $V_{nl}$ 
and it is defined as $V_{tol}=V_e+V_{nl}$, where $V_{tol}$ 
"may reveal the effects of adaptation, pathologies and skills learning".
Also, \cite{preatoni2013} noted that their work only investigate error from 
biological variability (e.g. $V_{eb}$) which does not consider non-biological noise 
resulting from measuring instruments or data post-processing techniques, such 
non-biological noise has high frequency components that are usually removed.
Therefore, the work of \cite{preatoni2010} and \cite{preatoni2013} 
do not consider an overall index to quantify movement variability but 
the combination of both $V_{eb}$ and $V_{nl}$. 
With that in mind, \cite{preatoni2007} analysed the influences of 
$V_{eb}$ and $V_{nl}$ for movement repeatability by comparing entropy measures 
(e.g. ApEn and SampEn) with values of their surrogate counterparts.


Generally, the previous approaches reported different models 
for movement variability which then are quantified with different tools.
For instance, \cite{hatze1986} and \cite{preatoni2010, preatoni2013} 
use entropy measures as the authors consider that the origin of the 
signals in the human body is the result of deterministic and 
stochastic processes, whereas 
\cite{muller2004} and \cite{seifert2011} reported only
statistics as a measure of magnitude that limited the evaluation of the 
whole trajectories as structures of movement variability in human body activities.
%\cite{stergiou2011} 
%pointed out that nonlinear measurement tools revealed that is not the magnitude 
%that is important but the structure of movement variability.
%that helps 
%to understand human-perceptual-motor functioning which led us to 
%the next section of measurements of variability.
Therefore, for this thesis, it is important to note that
even with the proposed models for movement variability 
\citep{hatze1986, preatoni2010, preatoni2013, muller2004, seifert2011} 
which have been quantified with either statistical or nonlinear tools,
little has been investigated with regards to the reliability of the nonlinear 
tools when using real data that has the property of being noisy, deterministic,
stochastic or nonstationary \citep{newell1998}.
A further reviewed of nonlinear tools is presented in Chapter 2.
%\citealt[p. ?]{newell1998} stated that movement variability can be considered as 
%"an emergent property of determinism, stochastic, and even singular processes
%in an evolving nonstationary dynamical system". 
%as explained by \cite{newell1993} 
%where variability is part of the exploitation of the workspace.





\subsection{Movement Variability in Human-Humanoid Interaction}


Movement variability in the context of human-humanoid interaction has been 
investigated for exercising, rehabilitation and dancing purposes. 

\cite{gorer2013} conducted an experiment of a robotic fitness coach 
where eight elderly participants performed five gestures: 
three for arm related exercises and two for leg strength exercises. 
Hence, \cite{gorer2013} with only graphical 
visualisation of join angles trajectories, extracted from the pose estimation
of a kinect sensor, 
%was presented for the movement performance in order to 
stated that only one subject out of eight fail to imitate the gestures correctly.
Additionally to the limitations of mapping human movements to a humanoid robot
due to the differences in their degrees of freedom which were compensated 
with auditory feedback, \cite{gorer2013} surveyed 
participants using a 5-point Likert scale about the positive and negative effect, 
flow, immersion and challenge of the human-robot interaction activity, concluding 
that their system is easy to use based on the high scores for immersion and 
positive effect and low scores for challenge and negative effect.


%\cite{gorer2013} pointed out that three out of the four DOF for NAO arm are for the shoulder
%and one for the elbow with its a limitation for the production of direct mapping
%from human arm join angles.
%Skeleton join angles collected using an a Kinect (RGB-D camera) mounted on Nao's head.
%It was reported that 
%from the eight participants of which only one did not imitated the gesture correctly.

Another example is the work of \cite{guneysu2014} who conducted experiments 
with children for upper 
arm rehabilitation using a play-like child robot interaction.
Hence, \cite{guneysu2014}, using a Kinect sensor to get data of join angles of 
the participants` skeleton, performed an automatic evaluation of three upper body 
actions (shoulder abduction, shoulder vertical flexion and extension, 
and elbow flexion) of eight healthy children who mimicked an humanoid robot.
To evaluate motion imitation, \citealt[p. 202]{guneysu2014} considered similarity 
error using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) that penalise large angle errors over ten 
percent in the area range of the motion type and applied recall measure 
as a representation of "how much of angular area of the baseline motion
from the humanoid robot is also covered by the child's motion".
%\cite[p. 202]{guneysu2014}.
Then, \cite{guneysu2014} presented the evaluation of five physiotherapists using 
Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) which a metric for reliability of 
ratings for motion types, and reported that for the first motion, which 
consists of only one join, the metric and physiotherapist evaluations 
showed hight agreements, whereas for the second and third motions, 
which motions were harder and complicated consisting of more join values, 
the evaluation between the metrics and physiotherapist presented differences.
\citealt[p. 203]{guneysu2014} stated that during the evaluation of complicated 
and harder movements, children misperceived the actions for which "therapists
compensated such misunderstanding by giving hight scores to the children
while the proposed system only considered angles".
With that, it is interesting to note that the proposed metrics of similarity 
error and recall measure with the ICC metric are not completely reliable since 
they did not model well complex movements.
%\cite{guneysu2014} used a moving average filter with a window size of 
%50 frames to smooth the data and eliminate unnecessary fluctuations 
%of local minima and maxima.
%Then peak detection of smoothened and unsmoothed data were performed to find 
%alignment of motion directions.
%Evaluation of five therapist using Intraclass correlation coefficient.
%Following the work of Ranatunga et al. which use DTW for the evaluation 
%of similarly of movements  performance between robot and person,
%\cite{guneysu2014} implement DTW with a window size of three frames.
%\cite{guneysu2014} evaluated physiotherapist's evaluation using intraclass
%correlation coefficient based on pooled variance within subjects and 
%variance of the trait between subjects, however the original formula
%proposed in [http://www.john-uebersax.com/stat/icc.htm]
%were modified as true values were not known. 
Recently, \cite{guneysu2015} presented an improvement of their previous research
where less complex movements from four physiotherapists performing five actions 
were analysed: opening a door with a key, 
touching the opposite shoulder with hand, taking an object from back to neck, 
taking an object from the back and reaching an object above the head.
Then, \citealt[p. 252]{guneysu2015} applied traditional statistics 
(e.g. sample mean and sample variance) to characterise the five actions.
For instance, the  initial positions of arms changed from person to person, 
specially for the key turning action which variation were affected by the 
sample mean, while performances of turning the amplitude of the arm
were associated with the standard deviation of the data.
%Additionally, different the structures of time series were presented from 
%each of the physiotherapist, where for instance, Therapist 2 performed the 
%activity at half amplitude compared to the others.
%reported quaternions data collected with two inertial sensors 


Movement variability in the context of human-humanoid interaction has also been
investigated in robotic dance activities.
For example, \cite{tsuchida2013} explored four dance formations which were performed 
three times by nine participants who had three years of experience: 
dancing with a robot, dancing alone, dancing with a self-propelled robot and dancing 
with a projected video.
To visualise dance movements, \cite{tsuchida2013} presented two participant's 
movement positions with twelve trajectories each (four dance activities times 
three trials) of z and x directions obtained with a Kinect sensor.
Although, dance experiment was rich in terms of movement variability
for both participants and dance activities, only distance between each of 
the conditions in the dance formation was considered. 
With that, \cite{tsuchida2013} concluded that the sense of dancing with a 
projected video of a person were the closest to dance with a real person and 
the trajectory of dance with a self-propelled robot were the closest 
to the trajectory of a dancer. Additionally, \cite{tsuchida2013} only applied 
traditional statistics (e.g. ANOVA) to characterise dance movements.
%considered a choreography of three elements 
%of interseciton (front to back), approaching,
%and parallel translations.






Another aspect of movement variability in the context of human-humanoid 
interaction is the generation of robotic dance.
Recently, \cite{peng2015} reviewed an hierarchical taxonomy of 
four categories of robotic dance (cooperative human-robot dance, 
imitation of human dance motions, synchronisation for music and 
creation of robotic choreography).
\cite{peng2015} pointed out that the creation of robotic dances is still 
an open research question because dance motions should generally be both 
interesting and exiting for users. 
According to \cite{peng2015}, the creation of robotic dances can be 
accomplished with any of the following methodologies:
(i) random generation where robots can be 
preprogrammed with series of predefined algorithms that can be chosen randomly,
(ii) mapping rule where robots can react, and therefore dance, to different 
factors such as colours, sounds, speech, temperature or human activity,
(iii) chaotic dynamics which systems are sensitive to initial conditions and 
therefore create various dance styles from periodic and couple to rhythm to 
jumping styles, resulting in innovative and consistent dance patterns,
(iv) interactive reinforcement learning where the robot can automatically choose 
motions based on rewards of participants' preferences 
of graceful motions,
(v) evolutionary computation in which multiple iterations of generations
of dance motions can create graceful robotic dance motions, and
finally (vi) using a Markov chain model, a discrete time stochastic chain, 
where each sequence of dance motions is considered as a state in the Markov 
chain producing dance that synchronise with music and emotions.
Therefore, while the research questions of this thesis are not fully related 
to the creation of good robotic dances (e.g, being innovative or having 
accordance with human aesthetics) \citep{peng2015}, it is important to note 
that one of the methodologies to create robotic dance motions is the use of 
chaotic dynamics
% With that in mind, creating robotics dances requires a methodology 
which consider initial conditions to generate movements 
that are neither deterministic or stochastic.
%\cite{peng2015}
%imentined that imitation in human dance motions
%to do imitation, one can do it by using task model
%where the learning from oberation technique is occupied
%however 
%due to the mecahincal and hardwrader software limitation of dance
%robots 
%the robots is only able to imitate 
%"the essential parts in human dance motions"
%since persons that create the dance patterns have different
%antropphmorphic carahcteristicts.


%%\subsection{Movement imitation}
%\cite{ijspeert2002} presented various scenarios for applications of humanoid robotics in
%rehabilitation where, for example, a robot can supervise rehabilitation exercises 
%in stroke patients from demonstrations of professional therapist, 
%demonstrating the motion with a robot, evaluating the performance of the patient and suggesting 
%and demonstrating corrections.

%Similarly, \cite{ijspeert2002} proposed the system of nonlinear
%differential equations which form a control policy for imitation of reaching 
%movements, comparing trajectories of two-dimensional single-stroke patterns,
%and learning tennis swings with a humanoid robot.

Although, movement variability in the context of human-humanoid interaction
has not been directly investigated in recent years, it can be noted 
that movement variability is indeed applied in exercise, 
rehabilitation or dance.
Hence, it can be noted that the previous works that has analysed gestures, 
movements or dance activities with only traditional statistics, for which
(i) it is not only clear how \cite{gorer2013} performed the evaluation of 
synchronisation for gestures between participants and the humanoid
but also what methods of evaluation, apart from the visual, 
has been applied to classify correct gestures trajectories,
 whereas (ii) little has been investigated with regards to the 
differences in movement of the invited physiotherapists in the work of
\cite{guneysu2014} and  \cite{guneysu2015},
(iii) in the results of \cite{tsuchida2013}, it is not clear, 
for their results, why the distribution of trajectories for subject 1 
were more uniform than the trajectories of subject 2, and
(iv) even thought, the robot movements for the experiments of this thesis 
are simple, \cite{peng2015} noted that  generation of robotic dance 
movements can be done with chaotic dynamics.


Therefore, it is generally highlighted that applying nonlinear analyses 
instead of traditional statistics in the context of human-humanoid 
interaction might provide a better quantification and understanding
of human movements since these are generally both deterministic and stochastic.
Similarly, little research has been done in this context 
with regards to the reliability of nonlinear tools 
when using real-data time series (e.g. window length, post-processing techniques, 
noise contamination, nonstationarity, chaotic deterministic, etc).






\section{Research questions and contributions}

A number of questions regarding movement variability has been investigated
\citep{stergiou2006, stergiou2011}, such as how is variability controlled 
while learning a new skill? \citep{wagner2012, seifert2011, bartlett2007}, 
is variability associated with disease or health? 
\citep{stergiou2006, stergiou2011}, what are the sources of variability 
and how do they interact in the production of observed variation 
of movement? \citep{preatoni2007, preatoni2010, preatoni2013}.
Nonetheless, little has been investigated with regards to the reliability of 
nonlinear tools to quantify movement variability \citep{iwanski1998, yao2017}
when dealing with real-world data \citep{bradley2015, caballero2014}.
Therefore, this thesis explores the effects on three nonlinear tools
(e.g. Reconstructed State Space (RSS), Recurrence Plots (RP) and 
Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA)) of  different features 
of time series such as structure, levels of smoothness and window lengths.
To do such exploration, two experiments were conducted with twenty 
right-handed healthy participants: (i) one for human-image imitation 
activities and (ii) another in the context of human-humanoid imitation activities.
For the experiments participants were asked to imitate simple arm movements
and participants and humanoid robot were attached with inertial sensors 
that collected time series.
Therefore, three research questions are investigated in this thesis.

\begin{itemize}

\item How sensitive or robust are RQA metrics to quantify movement 
	variability?

\item What are the effects on RSSs, RPs, and RQA metrics
	for different embedding parameters, different recurrence thresholds 
	and different characteristics of time series (window length, 
	smoothness of the signal, structure)?

\item How much smoothing of the raw signal is appropriate in order to 
	capture the nature of the variability?

\end{itemize}




\section{Thesis structure}

This thesis is organised as follow. 
Section 2 presents a review of the state space reconstruction 
that includes an explanation for uniform time delay embedding and a 
description of the techniques to estimate of minimum embedding 
parameters (e.g. false nearest neighbour and average mutual information).
Section 3 presents an introduction to Recurrence Plots,
structures of Recurrence Plots and different metrics to perform 
Recurrence Quantification Analysis.
In section 4, an experiment in the context of human-robot imitation
activities is presented where description of participants, data collection 
from inertial measurement unit sensors,
and preprocessing techniques (e.g raw data, normalised data, smoothed data 
and windowing) are given.
In section 5, results for RSS, RP and RQA are presented understand 
movement variability both between participants and activities, 
as well as the variation of smoothness of the time series.
The research is finalised in conclusion and future work.
