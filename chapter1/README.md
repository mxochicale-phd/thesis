added: Fri  7 Sep 13:49:41 BST 2018





* [ ] restate the research questions with the style of \cite{pincus1991}:

```
The purpose of this paper is to give a preliminary mathematical
development of a family of formulas and statistics,
Approximate Entropy (AppEn), to quantify the concept of changing complexity.
We ask three basic question:
(i) Can one certify chaos from a converge dimension (or entropy) calculation?
(ii) If not, what are we trying to quantify, and what tools are available?
(iii) If we trying to establish that a measure of system complexity 
is changing, can we do so with far fewer data points needed,
and more robustly than with current available tools?

\citealt[p. ?]{newell1998} stated that movement variability can be considered as 
"an emergent property of determinism, stochastic, and even singular processes
in an evolving nonstationary dynamical system".

* [ ] incorporate from \cite{caballero2014} the following liteature of RQA

Recurrence Plots and RQA for analysis the degree of irregulariy of the time seires

* [ ] incorporate from \cite{caballero2014} the following liteature of LyE
```
Several authors
have used Lyapunov Exponent (LyE) to assess local stability of a dynamical
system in human movement (Abe, Chen and Pham, 2014; Buzzi et al., 2003;
Rispens et al., 2014; Rosenstein, Collins and De Luca, 1993; Sano and Sawada,
1985; Zeng, Eykholt and Pielke, 1991). The LyE provides a qualitative picture of
a system's dynamics and it has been used, for example, to assess aging changes
(Buzzi et al., 2003), to assess the sitting postural control in infants (Cignetti,
Kyvelidou, Harbourne and Stergiou, 2011) or to describe patterns of gait
variability across the lifespan in people with Down Syndrome (Smith, Stergiou
and Ulrich, 2011).

%References that define movement variability as characteristic of 
%multiple level of movement organisation that occurs not only between 
%but also within individuals.
%Another problem is the variability between-subjects and between-days 
%that Sandlund2016 et al. which helped to conclude that MV can be 
%considered as a personal trait.
%%Such work aimed to have better understanding of motor 
%%coordination of complex activities, however we believe that 
%%better understanding can be made with nonlinear dynamics.

Extend the investigation of the hourglass model:
\cite{seifert2011} proposed an hourglass shape to model movement varialibyt of 
swimmers. The hourglass model has been tested using 
hierechical clustering analysis 
which has been used 
"to detect inter-individual differences of coordination patters in executin football shots"
Chow, Davids, Button, and Rein (2008)
or to explore differences of skill performance for basketball hook shoot

This has nothign to to do with movement varaiiablity, however,
investigated the source of neck pain is interesting

Movement variability has also been used  as an analysis of risk factors (
