* [ ] restate the research questions with the style of \cite{pincus1991}:

```
The purpose of this paper is to give a preliminary mathematical
development of a family of formulas and statistics,
Approximate Entropy (AppEn), to quantify the concept of changing complexity.
We ask three basic question:
(i) Can one certify chaos from a converge dimension (or entropy) calculation?
(ii) If not, what are we trying to quantify, and what tools are available?
(iii) If we trying to establish that a measure of system complexity 
is changing, can we do so with far fewer data points needed,
and more robustly than with current available tools?
