Uzal et al propose a methodology based on the minimization of a cost function L
to compute optimal embedding parameters which in previous works are
subjective practitioner-dependent choices on the location of the first local
minimum of the Mutual information or the value of a threshold of the false nearest
neighbours.

The cost function L is a local property of the reconstruction
which is then avarage over the attractor. L is build upon the concept of noise
amplification which is introduced by Casdagli.
