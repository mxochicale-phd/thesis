}


the notation in this article used \delta for delays and o_t as the time series
o_t = W(x_t)
which is genereated by a measurement function w:R^k \arrow R
as a smooth map from the state space to a scalar value.
smooth in this context means continuously differentiable

Author provide an explanation about the time-delay embeddings for which it is noted
that a one-to-one local structure should be preserved
