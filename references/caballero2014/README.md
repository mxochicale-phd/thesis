Comments to consider in the REPORTING OF ANALYSIS section.


The use of state space representation to model variability is well
received in

To obtain the state space representation,
Taken's Theorem is applied to the time-series in which m (dimension) and tau
(time-delay) are computed using False Nearest Neighbour and mutual
information methods. Then PCA is applied so as to access the first
three components
for analysis. For the revision, we are planning to show artificial data
representations so that the reader have an intuitive idea of the analysis.
and to show the transerability of the method for another human activities.

We are in a very early stage of the research, and many things
have to be done using  different non-linear analysis tools have
been used to measure human movement variability (Caballero et al).
