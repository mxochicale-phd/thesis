AB  - The study of postural control has been dominated by experiments on the maintenance of quiet upright standing balance on flat stationary support surfaces that reveal only limited modes of potential configurations of balance stability/instability. Here we examine the self-organization properties of postural coordination as revealed in a dynamic balance task with a moving platform. We scaled a control parameter (platform frequency) to investigate the evolving nature of the coupled oscillator dynamics between center of mass (CoM) and platform. Recurrent map measures were used to reveal whether episodic postural control strategies exist that can be scaled by systematically changing the magnitude of platform motion. The findings showed that at higher platform frequencies (1.2â€‰Hz), the CoM-Platform coupling was less deterministic than lower platform frequencies and evolved to intermittent postural control strategies that oscillated between periodic-chaotic transitions to maintain upright postural balance. Collectively, the recurrence map measures indicated that quasi-static postural attractor states were progressively emerging to the changing task constraints of platform frequency in the maintenance of postural stability. It appears that several dynamic modes of intermittent coupling in postural control can interchangeably co-exist and are expressed as a function of the control parameter of platform frequency.
