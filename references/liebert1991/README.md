  abstract={Guided by topological considerations, a new method is introduced to obtain optimal delay coordinates for data from chaotic dynamic systems. By determining simultaneously the minimal necessary embedding dimension as well as the proper delay time we achieve optimal reconstructions of attractors. This can be demonstrated, e.g. , by reliable dimension estimations from limited data series.}
