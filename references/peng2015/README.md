imentined that imitation in human dance motions

to do imitation, one can do it by using task model
where the learning from oberation technique is occupied
however 
due to the mecahincal and hardwrader software limitation of dance
robots 
the robots is only able to imitate 
"the essential parts in human dance motions"
since persons that create the dance patterns have different
antropphmorphic carahcteristicts.


one aspect of robotic dances is the creation of robotic chroeography
where movemetns can be genereated via random genreations, mapping rule,
chaos dynamnics, interactive reinforment leraning, 
evolurioanry computatoons or marvo chaine models.
