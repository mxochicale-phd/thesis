    abstract = { The detection and diagnosis of bearing health status using vibration signal has been an important subject for extensive research over the past few decades. The objective of this paper is to proposed permutation entropy as a tool to select best wavelet for feature selection for the detection as well as fault classification of ball bearings. The continuous wavelet coefficients of the time domain signal are calculated at real, positive scales using various real and complex wavelets. Best wavelet and corresponding scale is selected based on minimum permutation entropy. Eleven statistical parameters were used for defect classification in outer race, inner race, ball defect and healthy bearing respectively. Proposed methodology for fault classification is compared with two artificial intelligence techniques such as artificial neural network and support vector machine. Results revealed that permutation entropy based feature extraction techniques provide higher classification accuracy even when there is a slight variation in operating condition which is useful for development of online fault diagnosis. }
