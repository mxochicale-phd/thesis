# The first paragraph
 of the introduction is well motivated with regard to the use of
multivariate phase space reconstruction.

# For the second paragraph,
an smooth deterministic dynamical system
s(t)=f(s(t_0)) which is described in a $d-$dimensional manifold.


x_{(i)} = h [  s(  t=iX\delta ) ]

\delta is the sampling time



# In the third paragraph:
authors explain its methodology to compute the embedding paramters from their
previous where in order to apply the same technique to the case of the
multivariate time-delay embedding
* It is recommended to read more about the [8] to have a better understanding
for the basic principle of false nearest neighbour method
