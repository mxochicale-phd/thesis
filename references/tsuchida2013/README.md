\cite{tsuchida2013} concluded that the sense of dancing with
a projected video of a person were the closest to dance with a real person
and the trajectory of dance with a self-propelelled robot were 
the closes to the trajectory of a dancer.
Experiment considered four dance formations which were perfomred three times
by nice particpants: 
dancing witha robot, dancing alone, dancing witha self-propelled robot
and dancing witha projected video.
Particpants had three years of experience.
\cite{tsuchida2013} considered a chorepogramy of three elemens 
of interseciton (front to back), approaching,
and parralled trasnlations.
\cite{tsuchida2013} presented trajectories of two sujects to show
that dacing with a mirror is the closes to dance with a person.
However, it is not very clear how these trajectories were computed 
and why subejct 1 trajectories distrubtions is more uniform than
the trajectories of subject 2 whihch were more difficul to compare.
