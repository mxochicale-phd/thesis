movment varialibuyt might be a "negative by-product
in the central nervous sytems that should be minimised or elminated"
3-5.
However, from a dynamical view, 
such varilaibyt is viewed as 
"search for stable and functional states of coordinations"
[Davids K, Button C, Bennett S. Dynamics of skill acquisition: a
constraints-led approach. Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics; 2008.]
As the skill acquistions is increasing narrowded bandwithd of 
motor varilaibyt is exhivited which can be considered as "controlablel
chaos", e.g.  "subtle adaptations of movmemtns to continusouly 
fluctating constrains on action. " glazier.

Chapman et al 2009
reported that novice cyclist exhibit significnatly greater varialbiyt in
hip-ankle and knee-ankle join couplings than experts.


Establishign the role of movement varloiabulilty is still an open avenuen
where for exmaple the inmvesr relationshipd between movment varliabyt 
and sillis level is not completely supporter in the literature where 
for example less skilled perfomrances preseted  a reductions of varilaibyt

Sertegio ponted out that nolienar measuremament tools revelead 
that is not the magnituce that is important but the strucuter of 
movmente varialbiyt that  helps to undertand human-perceptual-motor functioning1718.
