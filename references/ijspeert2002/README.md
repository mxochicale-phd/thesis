Ijspeert et al. \cite{ijspeert2002} presented various scenarios for humanoid 
robotis for rehabilitation where robot can supervise rehabilitation exercises 
in stroke patients from demostration of profesional threrapist, demostrating the 
motion with a robot, evaluating the performance of teh patient and suggesting 
and demostrating corrections.
Similarly, Ijspeert et al. \cite{ijspeert2002} proposed the system of nonlinear
differential equations which form a control policy for imitation of reaching 
movments, comparingt trajectories of two-dimensional single-stroke patterns,
and learning teniss swings with a humanoid robot.
