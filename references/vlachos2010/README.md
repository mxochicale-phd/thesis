## Comments

Then, by 2010 Vlachos et al. \cite{vlachos2010} pointed out some issues with the multivariate
state space reconstruction using nonuniform time delay embedding.
One of the drawbacks when dealing with the time series that come from different sources
is the normalisation which often scaled the time series in order to have the same
variance and rage.
Similarly, in the time-delay embedding the problem of irrelevance is presented 
when time series are generated by another dynamical system. 
The opposite problem with multivariate time series is the redundancy of information
where time series can be synchronised or lagged correlated which might result
in overlay information in time-delay embedding.

Vlachos et al. \cite{vlachos2010} used the conditional mutual information
instead of mutual information which reduce the bias and it is more efficient.
Additionally, they propose two values to quantify the information flow:
S for prediction measure and R for information measure.

The nonuniform multivariate embedding method is applied in EEG recordings of
two epileptic patients.

According to the review of Vlachos et al. \cite{vlachos2010},
the embedding parameters for nonuniform time-delay embedding can be computed
using a minimum description length criterion
\cite{rissanen1978, small2002, small2004} or false nearest neighbour statistic \cite{garcia2005e71}.
