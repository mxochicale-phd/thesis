\cite{gorer2013}
pointed out that three out of the four DOF for NAO arm are for the shoulder
and one for the elbow with its a limitation for the production of direct mapping
from human arm join angles.
Limitations of DOF from robots are compensated with auditory fedback 
to deal with complex movemetns.
Eight particpatns performed an experiment of five gestures where
three of them were for arm related exercises of arm stretching and relaxation 
exercises. Skeleton join angles collected using an a Kinect (RGB-D camera) mounted on Nao's head.
Syncronisation of human's and robot's movements help to visualise the 
degree of sycronication wehre for exmaple a gold standard movement performed 
by the robot is imitated by other particpants. It was reported that 
from the eight particpatns of which only one did not imitated the gesture correctly.
