abstract = "Many complex and interesting phenomena in nature are due to nonlinear phenomena. The theory of nonlinear dynamical systems, also called ‘chaos theory’, has now progressed to a stage, where it becomes possible to study self-organization and pattern formation in the complex neuronal networks of the brain. One approach to nonlinear time series analysis consists of reconstructing, from time series of EEG or MEG, an attractor of the underlying dynamical system, and characterizing it in terms of its dimension (an estimate of the degrees of freedom of the system), or its Lyapunov exponents and entropy (reflecting unpredictability of the dynamics due to the sensitive dependence on initial conditions). More recently developed nonlinear measures characterize other features of local brain dynamics (forecasting, time asymmetry, determinism) or the nonlinear synchronization between recordings from different brain regions. Nonlinear time series has been applied to EEG and MEG of healthy subjects during no-task resting states, perceptual processing, performance of cognitive tasks and different sleep stages. Many pathologic states have been examined as well, ranging from toxic states, seizures, and psychiatric disorders to Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Cre1utzfeldt-Jakob's disease. Interpretation of these results in terms of ‘functional sources’ and ‘functional networks’ allows the identification of three basic patterns of brain dynamics: (i) normal, ongoing dynamics during a no-task, resting state in healthy subjects; this state is characterized by a high dimensional complexity and a relatively low and fluctuating level of synchronization of the neuronal networks; (ii) hypersynchronous, highly nonlinear dynamics of epileptic seizures; (iii) dynamics of degenerative encephalopathies with an abnormally low level of between area synchronization. Only intermediate levels of rapidly fluctuating synchronization, possibly due to critical dynamics near a phase transition, are associated with normal information processing, whereas both hyper—as well as hyposynchronous states result in impaired information processing and disturbed consciousness."

3.4. Checking the validity of the analysis: surrogate data testing

Thus a significant difference between the original data and the
surrogate data can be due to nonlinearity, non stationarity or
a combination of both. This problem has been discussed by
several authors (Popivanov and Mineva, 1999; Rieke et al.,
2003; Timmer, 1998). Surrogate data based upon wavelets
could present a possible way out (Breakspear et al., 2003a).
Another problem arises in the case of almost periodic time
series (Small and Tse, 2002; Theiler et al., 1993). One
possible solution to this problem, and possibly also to the
problem of non stationarity, is to use time reversed copies of
the original signal as ‘surrogate data’ (Stam et al., 1998).
