\cite{guneysu2015} reported quaternions data collected with two inertial senrsos 
from four physiotherapists performing five actions repeated tne times each.
Using basic statistical features (sample mean and sample variance),
\cite{guneysu2015} found that initial positions changed from person to person,
speciallly for the keyturning action. On the other hand,
Therapics 2 performed the activitie af half amplitude comparad to the others
and each therapics pressent different structures in the time series.
