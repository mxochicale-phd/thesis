Hateley gives a compresive explanation of the formulation of the
lorenz system that involve the momentum equation
continuity equation, Fourier-Galerkin expansion,
equation of vorticyty.

It is also a good reference to understand the different
behvaiors for the initial conditions and the constants
in the Lorenz system, and time windowing.
