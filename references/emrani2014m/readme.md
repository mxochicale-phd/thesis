Authors use a two dimensional time-delay embedding for wheeze detection
where wheezes are used "as an indicator of airway obstruction"
For some unkonnw reason authors refer to literature in DNA where is also
tackles the problem of disovering periodicity in time series, and three
works are cited
4 Tuqan 2009; 5 Song 2013; 6 Wichert 2004.
compater to one of each of the following areas of application
speech processing [1]
image compression artifacts [2]
patterned texture analysis [3]




Authors propose a two dimensional time-delay embedding  
W(t)=w(t), w(t-T)
where w(t) > ||R and T is the delay embedding.

Is interested to know that in [12], the two dimensional time-delay embedding
produce concentric ellipses with angles rotation of +-\pi /4.
Also in [12] is probed that W(t) has a topological hole when
one use the appropriate delay embedding.
