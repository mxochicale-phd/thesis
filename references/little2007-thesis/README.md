Little 
investigated why nonlinear time-series analysis

in speech singals.
one of the contribution is the stamment that 

speech signals whcih are characterised by determinsngc and ramdomess
for which recurrece analysis for periodic and aperiodic dyamics
and fractal scaling analysis for the stochastic compones that 
showm statsitic self-similaty





* Little introduced the use of Stochastic Taken's Embedding Theorem [70].
which is more appropriate for the traditional Taken's Embedding
Theorem which is for deterministic systems (page 65).

On section 6.3.1 Recurrence Probablity Density Entropy Algorithm,
little state that time-delay reconsturcint from stochastic signals
where the false nerightes neight and avergae mutual information 
are not applicatble to detemrinme the optimal values for 
embedding parameters (m and $\tau$).



* 

For which little use an approach in 8
that optimise the selection of embedding parametres m and $\tau$
Such optimisation is carried out by a systematic grid search of values.

The problem of selectin gthe right parameters is also one which face 
little mentioning that for his work, he do systematic search 
to find optimal parameteres
