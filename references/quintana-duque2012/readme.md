Non-linear Dynamic Invariants Based on Embedding Reconstruction of Systems for Pedaling Motion
Juan-Carlos Quintana-Duque

Types of Embeddings:
Uniform embedding which is defined as  
$v_n = y_n, y_{n-\tau}, ..., y_{n-(d_e -1)\tau}  $

Non-uniform embedding is determined by non equidistant consecutive delays
$ \tau_1 < \tau_2 < ... < \tau_{d_e - 1 } $ and defined as
$v_n = y_n, y_{n-\tau_1}, y_{n-\tau_2} ..., y_{n-\tau_{d_e - 1} }  $

"
non-uniform embedding were closer to theoretical,
specially for quasiperiodic and multiple time-scale time series

(Uzal,2011)




Quintana-Duque 2012 presend some interesteresting problems with the Uniform
embedding to which he provide examples where the non-uniform embedding is a
better metric with the maxima Lyapunov exponent and recurrence period
density entropy to show behaviours of fatique as well as loads of work according to
the speed of the ciclys. He also pointed out that some of the problems with
the dynamic invariants is the little availalbity of clean data where
for example the uniform embedding work well, but for noisy data which is
what it is generally presendted in real situation the dynamic invariatns
find diffficul to deal with those problems.
