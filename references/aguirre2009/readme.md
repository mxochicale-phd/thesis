Review the
from Henry Poincare who introduced the concetps of phase portrait,
peridic orbit, return map, bifurcation map, fixed point
Then on the 70s with the work of Edwards Norton Lorenz and its Lorenz
contribute with the emergence of Chaos Theory
similar Takens presneted his work on the turbulence, Rossler presented a new
attractor.
Then by the beggining of the 80s a turning point on the area of nonlinear Dynamics
was based on the work of
and packard et al. 1980 "Geometry from time series" takens1981
where was proved that an unkmnown state space can be reconstructed using one dimensional data
using a diffeomorphic map.

by 90, the first words on the applications of packard and takens started to appear
casdagli1991 and saurer1991  
based on the state space reconstructed
works of goemtric measeremtns, lyapunov exponent and entrpies were
investigated. adapted and applied
Abarbanel et al. 1993
Kantz et al. 2004


Similarly, authors review five pionering areas that influence the work
of nonlinear dynamics:

1. The local linear predictors
2. Equations of Motion
3. Multivariable Functional Interpolation
4. Prediction of Chaotic Time Series
5. Constrection of Differential Equations

For which the Figure 2 is a good contribution of this paper where one can see the
historical sequence in which nonlinear dynamics were proposed by early 1980.


For the uniform and noninform delay embedding,
auhtors cite some reference to examplify the building of irregular embeddgins
Partilarty, authors refer to the work of \cite{judd1998}
"K. Judd and A. Mees, â€œEmbedding as a modeling problem,"
as turniung point in the use of nonuniform delay embadding theotem.
