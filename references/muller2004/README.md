muller and sternad proposed a model that decomposed valirabut into
exploration of task tolerance(T), noise reduction(N), and covariation(C).
For inititial blocks of experiemts, it was then concluded that T and N 
contribute more to improvement  of a perfomrance of a task than C, 
meaning that a new combination of angles and velocities explore a 
large region of solution space (hitting the target).
However, as part of later practice, T diminished  and N and C started to 
be more relevlant.
Muller and sternad explained that task space exploration is esential
is an essential contrbuiot tot he primprovement of movmente perfornaces
which is an explain the noise incrates in early pracitce phases
which is also presented in the  work of Newell corcos 1993
where variablity is part of the explotaion of the workspace.



The quality of perforomance in goal-oriented tasks, e.g. grasping an object or 
hitting a target, is defined "by the acuracity and replicablity of the 
results (deviations from the target) over repeated attempts of execution (configuration of join
angles with its velocity, angles and position). 
Therefore, Muller showed in various experimetns of throwing actions
that varilibyt in the movment resutls (deviations from the target) 
is genarally smaller  than variability in the execuation
( varaibles or release angles and velocities) for which 
it is concluded that covariation between exectuation variables
is antoher compoment of varilbity.
However, muller experimetns only considered single point data points
and not evaluation of trajectories.

which is a fundamentdal to explains why movements becase less noise 
as a function of practice.


"reduction of motor noise as consequence of practice is an
acknowledged component in skill improvement." \cite{muller}
