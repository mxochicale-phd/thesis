    abstract = { The present study examined the time and frequency structure of force output in adult humans to determine whether the changes in complexity with age are dependent on external task demands. Healthy young (20–24 yr), old (60–69 yr), and older-old (75–90 yr) humans produced isometric force contractions to constant and sine wave targets that also varied in force level. First, force variability on each force task increased with advancing age. Second, both time and frequency analysis showed that the structure of the force output in the old and older-old adults was less complex in the constant-force level task and more complex in the sine wave force task. Third, the alterations in force output with aging were primarily due to low-frequency bands <4 Hz. These results support the postulation that the observed increase or decrease in physiological complexity with aging is influenced by the relatively fast time scale of external task demands (Vaillancourt DE and Newell KM. Neurobiol Aging 23: 1–11, 2002). }
