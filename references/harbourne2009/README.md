Varibily is inherent to biological systems (that's from genes to behaviors in human movement)
which is realted to the survival of such biological systems.

Linear mearues of RANGE and  nonlinear tools of Approximate Entropy (ApEp)
can explain the behavios in the amplitude and structure of the time series [Figure 1]
to which it is concluded that the variables of variability can be related
to the the amount and the structure of the variablity itself.

By using periodic, chaotic and noisy time-series, Harbourne et al. provide
evidence that the phase space (signals are plotted versus their velocities)
that even signals which are chaotic provide information about the healthines
of the movements. However, althouht being a paper from 2009 (reading in 2017)
no real data from movevent is presented. [Figure 2]


Approciate Entropy can measure the regularity and precitability of the time series.
However, no limitations are mentions regaring the ApEp.
Similarly, the largest LyE (Lyapunov Exponen) is prensented with the aim of
measiring the divergence of movememnt trajectorires for example
as the noise is increase in the  time-series the divergence of trajectories
is also increate.
