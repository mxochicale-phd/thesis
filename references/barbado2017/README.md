Dear All,

I am interested in reading one of your papers (Barbado et al. 2017)*.
It is however not open-accessed at http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fxhp0000303

* Barbado Murillo, D., Caballero Sánchez, C., Moreside, J., Vera-García, F. J., & Moreno, F. J. (2017). 
Can the structure of motor variability predict learning rate?

Would mind sharing a copy of the paper to understand more about your reaserch!


Many Thanks
Miguel
