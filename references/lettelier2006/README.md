Chirtophe Letellier investigated the robusnest of 
the shannon entropy based on recurrence plots $S_{RP}$ against
the shannon entropy based on system dynamics $S_{SD}$.
Shannon entropy is is correlated with the inverse of the largest
Lyapunov Exponent. Shannon entropy quantifies the complexity of
the dynamics. 
Christophe Letellier replace the $Pn$ term in the original 
equation proposeed by Truall with the nonrecurrent points
of the recurrence plots, with that the $SRP$ 
shows a one-to-one correspondence with the positive 
Lyapunov exponent 
Regarding the shannon entropy based on system dynamics
the SSD is estimated by replacing $Pn$ with the relative
frequency of the $nth$ sequenceu made of $k$ symbols.

The advange of SRP against SSD is the robusness with
noise-contaminated signals and SSD depens on the 
partition of $nth$ sequence 
and the sequence lenght $k$

The negatives is that shannon entropy based on rp 
has strong deppendnece with choice of observable,
variable of the dynamical system.
When the shannon entropy is estimated using RP from 
time series and not with a Poincar\'e section, the SE
is not very sensitive to the complexity of the dynamics
for which is is recommended that the shannon entropy
from time series is used when the Poincar\'e section
is too difficul to obtain.
