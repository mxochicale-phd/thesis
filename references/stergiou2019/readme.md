abstract="In this paper I propose that happiness can be achieved by being variable in everything that we do. Being variable results in being adaptable in difficult situations such as dealing with other people that are different to you. By promoting variability in our lives, we can become more contented as we can overcome many obstacles. Striving to be variable in every aspect of our lives can promote a happier and healthier life that can translate to improved tolerance and adaptability in our social interactions. Variability in our lives can thus facilitate learning to live together.",
