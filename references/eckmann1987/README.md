## Overview
Eckmann et al. in 1987 \cite{eckmann1987} proposed the tool of recurrence plots
which works as follows:
"Let $X(i)$ be the $i-$th point in the orbit describing a dynamical system in a 
$d-$ dimensional space, for $i=1,\dots,N$. The recurrence plot, therefore, is 
an array of dots in a $N \times N$ square, where the dot is placed at $(i,j)$
whenever $X(i)$ is sufficient close to $X(j)$".
To create a recurrence plot based on time series $ \{ u_i \}$, we first 
compute the state space reconstruction, $X(i)$, with an embedding dimension $d$
$X(i)=( u(i, u_{i-\tau}, \dots, u_{i -(d-1)\tau })$. Then, one chooses $r(i)$ 
such that the ball of radios $r(i)$ centred at $x(i)$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ contains 
a reasonable number of other points $X(j)$ of the orbit. Finally, one plots 
a dot at each point $(i,j)$ for which $X(j)$ is in the ball of radius $r(i)$
centred at $X(i)$. 
Recurrence plots are characterised by the large-scale typology and small-scale texture.
There can be different typologies according to the dynamic sytems, these are
homogenous, drift or periodic and are related tot he patterns in the recurrence plots.
What is interesting is the small-scale texture whre short lines parallel to the diagonal 
of the recurrence plots of which lenght is related to the inverse of the 
Largest lyapunov exponent, also it can be noticed a checkboard texture where, 
for the case of Lorenz system, $X(i)$ moves on a spiral, sometimes around one,
sometimes around the other of the two simetric points of the system
