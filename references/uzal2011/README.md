Dear Lucas et al.

In your paper titled "Optimal reconstruction of dynamical systems: A noise amplification approach",
your provide a reference to download the C code for the computation of the dinamic invartiants.
Unfortunatelly, the link [http://www.cifasis-conicet.gov.ar/uzal/archivos/optimal_embedding.tar.gz] is not available in the server. I am therefore interested in having a copy of your souce code to
make some replications of your results with the aim of getting a more intuitive understanding of
the time-delay embedding theorem.



# nonuniform Delay Coordinate

"Delay selection for time series phase space reconstruction may be performed
using a mutual information (MI) criterion. However, the delay selection is in
that case limited to the estimation of a single delay using MI between two
variables only. A high-dimensional estimator of the MI may be used to select
more than one delay between more than two variables"

"The proposed scheme of optimal estimation of embedding parameters can be
viewed as a global non-uniform embedding. It has been found that the proposed
method is more efficient for estimating embedding parameters for reconstruction
of the attractor in the phase space than conventional uniform embedding methods."

" The weighted one-point crossover rule enables an effective identification of
near-optimal sets of non-uniform time lags which are better than the globally
optimal set of uniform time lags. Thus the reconstructed information on the
properties of the underlying dynamical system is directly elaborated in the
fuzzy prediction system."

"We propose an alternative approach that views the problem of choosing all
embedding parameters as being one and the same problem addressable using a single
statistical test formulated directly from the reconstruction theorems. This allows
for varying time delays appropriate to the data and simultaneously helps decide
on embedding dimension."
