abstract="In the last two decades recurrence plots (RPs)were introduced in many different scientific disciplines. It turned out how powerful this method is. After introducing approaches of quantification of RPs and bythe study of relationships between RPs and fundamental properties of dynamical systems, this method attracted even more attention. After 20 years of RPs it is time to summarise this development in a historical context.",
