# NOTES
The work of comotti has been published in the 2014 International Symposium of Inertial Sensors and Systems which was the first time it was organised.


# PAGE 3
Higher values of the relative difference between xsens MTi 20 with neMEMSi
are present for the yaw component since it is only based on the magentometer
which are also part of the local distorsions of the magnetic field.


# FIGURE 5
Pitch component seems to have a bias
and for each component the sensors seems to struggle with movement.


The neMEMSi sensors is compared againts the xsen MTi20
for which it can be said that
an average 3D static orientation accuracy of  0.55
(0.37+ 0.54 + 0.75)/3= 0.55
and
a 3D dynamic orientation accuracy of 0.056 which is lower
than 0.1 degrees for all  euler angles.
(0.49+.62+.59)/3= 0.5666667
