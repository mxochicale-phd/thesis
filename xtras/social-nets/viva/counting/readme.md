THE PROBLEM, however, is that such 'shallow or deep' 
understating would raise more 'shallower or deeper' 
questions"

In the begining you might be irresponsable or silly with the use of Mathematics
but I guess is like a using a foreing language that you are polishing in everyday usage. 
Nobody was born as a pure mathematitican!

DRAFTS 
```
Renaissence is now part of the history 
but going from draft to draft 

A thesis might not be a David, but 
try to put together the best 
a well-sculpted work 
that you have ever made

1. I did enjoy the process of sculpting my thesis,
in between drafts scientific/artistic ideas start to emerge 

ideas
* ...getting there. I guess, a PhD help one to understand your human limitation. 
methamorphosis 

* not sure what's happening but it is a sensation of being 
fully aware of your human limitation. 
```

in the darkness with two experienced entities
