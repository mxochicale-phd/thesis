Erratum notice
---

Colin Jones, Scholarly Communications Services Assistant, from Library Services of 
University of Birmingham has helped me to clarify some points
regarding the final version of the thesis for the 
[online](https://etheses.bham.ac.uk) ethesis repository.

I requested to put my thesis under embargo perdiod until 30 August 2019
due to the plan of its final publication in Github. However, 
the following changes has been made from the submitted thesis to the
version submitted in Github: 

* All links to code fragments which are contained within the main body of the thesis 
and the appendix have been updated and their link colour have been modified. 
See [here](
https://github.com/mxochicale-phd/thesis/commit/2e73527d3dc6d77dfd570912d33f50f5a6d0049b) for detailed information of those changes.

* The section ‘Surrogate data analysis’ (chapter 7, also within the main body of the thesis) has been partially reworded. 
See [here](https://github.com/mxochicale-phd/thesis/commit/c684a8953033bc59e41a8ce8216106434587ae20)  for detailed information of those changes.

* confirmed by Colin, has to be reported as
an erratum notice. That said Colin Jones discussed the previous points with research student 
administration to conclude that an erratum notice should be provided noting 
the previous changes.
