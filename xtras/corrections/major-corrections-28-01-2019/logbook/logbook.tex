It has been stated in Chapter \ref{chapter1} that movement variability can 
be modelled
and quantified with methods of nonlinear analysis mainly 
because
(i) the structures of the human physiology 
(e.g. lungs, neurons, etc.) suggest that many of their dynamics 
are controlled with nonlinear dynamics \citep{goldberger1990} 
and (ii) data from human movement can be chaotic-deterministic
noisy, deterministic, stochastic 
or non-stationary 
\citep{hatze1986, preatoni2010, preatoni2013, 
stergiou2006, newell1998, stergiou2011, caballero2014}.
Therefore, in this chapter fundamentals of time series, 
methods of nonlinear analysis to quantify movement variability 
and nonlinear analysis with real-world data are reviewed.

AMENDED SENTENCE(S) \\
	\begin{verbatim}
Complexity for this thesis refers to the dynamics of 
joint biomechanical degrees of freedom of a person 
performing a task in a certain environment \citep{davids2003}.
That said, \cite{vaillancourt2002, vaillancourt2003} 
stated that there is no universal 
increase or decrease in complexity for movement variability as a function 
of age or disease 
but a dependency with the task dynamics. For example, in a constant-force 
task (where the task dynamics is of low dimension), older adults 
present less complexity due their inability to introduce additional degrees 
of freedom in the neuromuscular system. However, there is an increase of 
complexity in older adults or unhealthy adults when the task dynamic is 
oscillatory because these adults have more difficulty to reduce 
the dimension output to a lower dimension which are the intrinsic dynamics 
of their resting state.
In contrast, inspired by \cite{tononi1998} who modelled complexity
with the variables of complexity versus regularity of neural networks,
\cite{stergiou2006} proposed a model for optimal human movement variability
with the variables of complexity versus predictability.
The model of \cite{stergiou2006} stated that higher complex movements are 
associated with rich behaviour of movements,
while lower complex movements 
are associated with poor behaviours of movements being too rigid or too 
unstable. Hence, higher complexity of movements are characterised by 
chaotic systems, while lesser complexity of movement is characterised either 
as noisy systems or periodic systems (having either low or high amounts of 
predictability) \citep{stergiou2006}.

Considering the works of \cite{vaillancourt2002, vaillancourt2003}, 
\cite{tononi1998} and \cite{stergiou2006}, 
I assume that the quantification of movement 
variability can be based on the complexity and predictability 
of human movement.

To tackle this correction, the following paragraphs has been added 
in Chapter 1 and then discussed in Chapter 7. Additionally,
an appendix has been added to perform surrogate data analysis
for the time-series data of the experiments in this thesis.

It is important to note that non-stationary 
and non-linearity of time-series data from human-humanoid interaction
activities is assumed in this thesis  
(see Chapter \ref{chapter7} for a discussion
on the reasoning, as posed by \citep{schreiber2000},
of making rather dangerous assumption).

\subsection*{Surrogate data analysis}
As it has been mentioned in Chapter \ref{chapter1},
non-stationary and non-linearity of time-series data 
from human-humanoid interaction has been assumed.
This can reflect my prejudice of the type of data 
and methods that are required to provide a fair 
quantification for movement variability.
%\citep{schreiber2000}
Hence after the viva examination, it has been suggested to 
test the non-linearity and non-stationary of time series data 
in this thesis.
To do that, surrogate data analysis has been performed 
for time-series data from the experiments and 
it can be said that the null hypothesis has only been rejected 
18 out 20 of the performance of vertical faster arm movements.
Whereas it has been rejected 11 times for vertical faster arm movements
from data of the participants.
Hence, more research require to be done as 
the null hypothesis is rejected and non-rejected for similar 
type of movements for humans and the robot.
Perhaps, apply the work of \cite{stam1998} 
for non-linearity test in experimental time series with 
strong periodic components using the method of 
nonlinear cross-prediction.

\section{Open Access PhD Thesis}
In 1901 the University of Birmingham published the first PhD thesis, 
in July 2011 the first electronic thesis were uploaded to e-thesis 
\citep{ethesis-bham}, 
and then, to the best of my knowledge, in 2019 my PhD thesis is the 
first published open accessed PhD thesis with code and data.
Hence, a github repository has been created for this thesis 
where references to open access software tools and data are 
available for others to use and perhaps help 
them to advance this field \citep{xochicale2018}.

\begin{enumerate}

\item  (pp. 1)  To tackle this correction, the following paragraph
were added in section 3.4.3 Overall minimum embedding parameters.

	\begin{verbatim}

It is also important to mention that a maximum of individual minimum 
dimension embeddings, $m_{0_i}$, can be used instead of the overall 
sample mean of individual minimum dimension embeddings. The rationale
for that is because the maximum value can unfold trajectories 
in the reconstructed state space that require a lower embedding 
dimension value. However such statement might be different 
for the maximum of individual minimum embedding delay as such 
maximum might not create the maximum independence 
between $x(n)$ and $x(n+\tau)$ for multiple time-series data.

parameters.

%to support arguments of the mechanical limitations of NAOj


%ADD EXPLANATION TO THIS COMMENT SOMEWHERE IN THIS SECTION 
%The normal and faster velocity of arm movements is defined by the duration in 
%number of samples of one repetition of NAO's arm movements.
%We select NAO's arm movements duration to distinguish between normal and 
%faster arm movements as the movements from the humanoid robot have less 
%variation between repetition to repetition. 
%The duration for one repetition of the horizontal 
%arm movement at normal velocity, HN, is about 5 seconds considering that 
%each repetition last around 250 samples. For horizontal arm movement at 
%faster velocity, HF, each repetition were performed in around 2 seconds 
%which correspond to 90 samples of data. 
%The vertical arm movement at normal velocity, VN, were performed  in 6 seconds 
%which is around 300 samples of data.
%For vertical arm movement at faster velocity, VF, each repetition lasts 
%about 2.4 seconds which correspond to 120 samples of data.
%To visualise the distinction between normal and faster velocity for horizontal 
%and vertical arm movements, Fig~\ref{fig:sts} shows smoothed time series 
%for axes Z and Y of the gyroscope sensors with four window lengths: 
%2-sec (100-samples), 5-sec (250-samples), 10-sec (500-samples) 
%and 15-sec (750-samples).

The following paragraphs were added in Chapter 7

\subsection*{How does the smoothing of raw time series affect 
	methods of nonlinear analysis when 
	quantifying movement variability?}

The answer to this question depends on 
(i) what to quantify in movement variability and also 
(ii) which hardware is involved in the collection of 
time-series data. 

.
.
.

Additionally, smoothing time-series data can preserve 
the structure of the dynamics of NAO's arm movements 
when applying nonlinear analysis, as sometimes NAO 
produces jerky arm movements due to  
(i) control of dynamic response (fast acceleration/deceleration), 
(ii) stiffness of gear mechanics, or 
(iii) the number of degrees of freedom
(see Appendix \ref{appendix:nao} for more about 
NAO's mechanical and dynamic capabilities).

\subsection*{Smoothing time-series data}
I hypothesised that one might create a closer representation of the 
nature of movement variability when using raw data from sensors.
However, the quality of raw time-series data can be affected 
by changes in sample rate, drift effect for long time-series data or 
changes of external variables such as 
temperature and magnetic fields for inertial sensors. 
Additionally, humanoid robots can sometimes produce
jerky movementes due ot its mechanical and dynamic capabilities.

That said, further investigation is required to be done
regarding the search of the appropriate balance between 
and the raw data and degree of smoothness 
to capture the nature of movement variability
in the context of human-humanoid interaction.

\section*{14. 3D surface plots}
\textbf{
Explain how the 3D surface plots are made --
you had to condense the axis labels, this 
does make the meaning hard to get 
so more explanation in the text is needed.

	The use of English for section "3.7.3 Some weaknesses and strengths of RP and RQA" 
	were polished  and then section "3.7.4 3D surface plots of RQA" were added to tackle this correction.

\subsection{3D surface plots of RQA} \label{sec:3d_rqa}
One approach to tackle some of the previously reviewed weaknesses and 
strengths of RP and RQA is the method of \cite{zbilut1992} 
in which 3D surface plots are created with an increase of 
embedding parameters ($m$ and $\tau$). 
\cite{zbilut1992} explored fluctuations and gradual 
changes in the 3D surface plots to provide information 
about the selection of embeddings parameters. 
Similarly, considering the work of \cite{webber2018}, 
\cite{marwan2015} pointed out that the creation 
of 3D surface plots are useful for visual selection of 
recurrence thresholds and embedding parameters 
(see Fig 1.16 in \cite{marwan2015}). 

With that in mind, I therefore propose a similar graphical approach 
based on the works of \cite{zbilut1992}, \cite{webber2018}, 
and \cite{marwan2015} in order to visualise fluctuations 
and changes of 3D surface plots of RQA.
Four variables are considered to create 3D surface 
plots of RQA for this thesis: 
(i) embedding dimension,
(ii) embedding delay,
(iii) recurrence threshold, and 
(iv) metrics of RQA. 
Fig \ref{fig:fig_37}(A) illustrates a 3D surface plot of RQA Entr  
with unitary increment of embedding parameters ($m$ and $\tau$)
for recurrence threshold $\epsilon=2.0$.
Then, Fig \ref{fig:fig_37}(A), with other variations of recurrence thresholds, 
is used to create Fig \ref{fig:fig_37}(B) where bands 
for values of $\tau$ are concatenated to form a long band
that is embedded into Fig \ref{fig:fig_37}(B) 
(as illustrated by the arrows).
Additionally, five time series with their 3D surface plots of 
RQA Entr are shown in Figs \ref{fig:fig_37}(C to G)
to illustrate how 3D surface plots of RQAEntr differ from each other.

	Four time-series data and their 3D surface plots of 
	RQA Entr for:
	(C) uniformly distribute noise,
	(D) super-positioned harmonic oscillation 
	($\sin{ \frac{1}{5} t} \sin{ \frac{5}{100}t) }$),
	(E) drift logistic map ($x_{i+1} = 4 x_i (1- x_i) $) corrupted 
	with a linearly increase term ($0.01 i$),
	(F) disrupted brownian motion  ($x_{i+1} = x_i + 2rnorm(1) $), and
	(G) $x(t)$ solution of Lorenz system.
	R code to reproduce the figure is available in \cite{xochicale2018}.
