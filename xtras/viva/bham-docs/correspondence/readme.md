Dear Miguel,

We will hold your viva at 13.30 on Friday 9th January. It will be in room N334.

If you wish you can prepare a short (no more than 10 minutes maximum) presentation outlining the research questions, methods, main results and conclusions which you can give at the start of the viva.

We will provide a pen and paper for you. You can bring some water to drink if you like during the viva. Do ask me if you have any questions.

Regards,

Tim
