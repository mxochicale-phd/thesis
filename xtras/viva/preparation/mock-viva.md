Mock viva
---

My suppervisor CB conducted a mock viva on 
Fri  4 Jan 2018. The mock viva lasted around 
one hour in which he gave some good pieces of 
advice on explaining with more clarity the 
main contribution of my thesis and also
asked me the following ten questions:

# Q1

You focus on human-humanoid interaction.
Why is this a topic that interest you and 
why is it import to study?

# Q2

What do you mean by the term 'variablity'?


# Q3
Explain how the Uniform time-Delay Embedding works.


# Q4
The techniques you use involve estimating $m$ and $\tau$.
You show that varying these parameters can affect the results.
So, ho do you know you have used the most appropriate values?

# Q5
Using $m$ and $\tau$ could distort the original data.
How do you know you have preserved the integrity of 
source data sufficiently?

# Q6
You obtained the most effective results from using Entropy.
How does this approach differ from UTDE? 
Is it surprising that entropy provide good results?

# Q7
Explain how Recurrence Quantification Plots should be interpreted.
What would a 'good' plot look like?

# Q8
Thinking about the application of your approach, 
what does this tell us that conventional signal processing
(like HMM) cannot?

# Q9
If a major robotics company was to take the ideas in the thesis,
how do you think they could apply them?

# Q10
What do you think is the most important contribution
that your research makes to engineering?
