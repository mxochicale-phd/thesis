\begin{frame}{Participants}

23 right-handed healthy participants were invited for two experiments, 
however some of these were not considered in the analysis 
due to technical problems with IMU's.

\begin{block}{Human-Image Imitation Activity}
6 participants ($p01, p04, p05, p10, p11, p15$) 
with mean and standard deviation (SD) age of mean=19.5 (SD=0.83) years. 
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Human-Humanoid Imitation Activity}
20 participants with mean and standard deviation (SD) age of mean=19.8 (SD=1.39) years,
being four females and sixteen males.
\end{block}
