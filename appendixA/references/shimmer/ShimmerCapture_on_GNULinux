Hi Miguel,



Many thanks for your email.


To answer your question; the only software support we have in Linux, is
ShimmerCapture [Linux], which can be downloaded
here<http://www.shimmersensing.com/images/uploads/docs/ShimmerCapture_for_Linux_v0.5.zip>,
the documentation for this is included in the zip. This application allows the
user to configure, stream, plot, record data from a single Shimmer over
Bluetooth. We also offer the source code for this application in the form of the
C# API which the can be modified as per your requirements to add more
functionality to the application. This can be downloaded
here<http://www.shimmersensing.com/images/uploads/docs/Shimmer_Csharp_API_v0.5.zip>
and the related documentation
here<http://www.shimmersensing.com/images/uploads/docs/Shimmer_C_API_User_Manual_Rev0.5a.pdf>.

There is a quick start section (2.5.1. Setting up a Shimmer data stream on
Linux,) in the Shimmer3 User Manual, which I have attached to this email.


Miguel, I hope you have found this helpful. For further technical support we
have a dedicated support team that are more than happy to assist with any
problems that you may be having or indeed any queries regarding the
Shimmers. You can contact them by filling out the
form<http://www.shimmersensing.com/support/wearable-sensing-support/> on our
website.


Kind Regards,


Katy

Dear Sir or Madam,



We want to capture data from Shimmer3 sensor in a GNU/Linux machine; therefore we follow the instruction in the section of ShimmerCapture on Linux.



I have to say that pairing the USB bluetooth connection is not a problem; however, I am wondering if you have an application that I can run on a GNU/Linux machine.



From the applications available at [1], you only provide executable applications for windows (ShimmerCapture v0.5_Linux.exe).
