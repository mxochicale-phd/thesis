\chapter{Open Access Code and Data} \label{appendix:a}

\section{Code and data organisation} 
Code path has ten directories with a descriptive name of their content
as shown below: 
\begin{verbatim}
0_machineinfo/
1_dependencies/  
2_libraries_functions/  
3_anthropometrics/      
4_figs_ch3/                        
5_creation_of_curated_timeseries/  
6_figs_ch4/  
7_figs_ch5/  
8_figs_ch6/
x_surrogate/
\end{verbatim}
Code path is available at \codelink{https://github.com/mxochicale-phd/thesis/tree/master/0_code_data/1_code}.
Data is organised in paths for raw data time series and 
preprocessed datasets \codelink{https://github.com/mxochicale-phd/thesis/tree/master/0_code_data/0_data}.

\section{How results can be replicated} 
This thesis has been written in GNU Linux Operating System.
Therefore, for the replication of this thesis, 
it is suggested that users install 
Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS or Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS on their machines 
(other GNU Linux distributions can also work).
Additionally, it is suggested installing the latest version of \R 
with all its dependencies and GNU Octave, version 4.0.2
(follow the alphabetic order of the scripts
to install all dependencies 
\codelink{https://github.com/mxochicale-phd/thesis/tree/master/0_code_data/1_code/1_dependencies}).

For figure replication, the paths are organised with three 
paths: \texttt{code/} contains \R scripts that create figures in \texttt{scr/}, 
and \texttt{vector/} contains the vector files.
