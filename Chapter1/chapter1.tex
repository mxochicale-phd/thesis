\section{What is loren ipsum? Title with math \texorpdfstring{$\sigma$}{[sigma]}} %Section - 1.1

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry (see
Section~\ref{section1.3}). Lorem Ipsum~\citep{Aup91} has been the industry's
Ipsum~\citep{AAB95,Con90,LM65}.

The most famous equation in the world: $E^2 = (m_0c^2)^2 + (pc)^2$, which is
known as the \textbf{energy-mass-momentum} relation as an in-line equation.

\section{Where does it come from?}  %Section - 1.3
\label{section1.3}

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots
in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.
Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum
passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature,
discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1
.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by
Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very
popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor
sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
