PhD Thesis
---

The current tamplate of the PhD thesis is based on the
[PhD thesis template for Cambridge University Engineering Department (CUED)](https://github.com/kks32/phd-thesis-template).
It is recommended to read the instructions on how to use the template
[USAGE.md](https://github.com/mxochicale/phd-thesis/blob/master/USAGE.md).


There is a README.md in each Chapter to refer to the original chapter1.tex file
and also as a logbook for any changes.
