%\subsection{General Consideration when selecting embedding parameters}
%Some extra considerations to take into account when choosing the embedding parameters
%are the following:
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item According to Takens \cite{takens1981}, the dimensionality of the 
%	reconstructed space, $m$, should be at least double the original 
%	dimensionality of the state space, $s$, $ m < 2*d < 0  < $ and
%	  $\tau$ should be, at least, greater than one.
%  \item The reconstructed attractor should not have to contain periodic orbits
%	of length $\tau$ or $2\tau$ and only finitely many periodic orbits of length $3\tau$,
%	$4\tau$,..., $m\tau$ which means that $\tau$ should not conflict with any
%	periodic orbit in the system \cite{frank2010, takens1981}.
%  \item The time window needed for uniform time-delay embedding is 
%	$ ( (m-1)\tau +1 ) / r $ seconds where $r$ is the sample rate of 
%	the data \cite{frank2010}.
%\end{itemize}
