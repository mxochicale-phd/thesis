\section{NeMEMsi IMU sensors}  \label{appendix:imus}
For this work, data were collected using NeMEMsi sensors \cite{Comotti2014}
that provide 3D accelerometer, 3D magnetometer, 3D gyroscope and quaternions
(Figure~\ref{fig:muse}).
It is important to note that NeMEMsi sensors 
were tested against the state-of-the-art device MTi-30 IMU from xsense.
The comparison values between NeMEMsi and MTi-30 in terms of standard deviation 
of the noise of each component of the Euler angles at a state state are lower 
than 0.1 degrees. 
Additionally, the NeMEMsi provide not only to have a lower-power consumption 
but also the smaller dimensions against other state-of-the-art brands of IMUs.
In the following sections, some features of the IMU are presented,
however, we refer the readers to check \cite{Comotti2014} for further details.

\subsection*{Sample rate and power consumption}
Data streaming can be set up to be streamed at 25 Hz, 50 Hz and 100Hz which
affects the power consumption from 29mAh, 32mAh and 35mAh, respectively.
For this work, the sample rate were set up to 50 Hz.

\section{Time-series preprocessing}

Code and data for the following sections is available in 
\citep{hwum2018}. However, the documentation and organisation of the 
repository will be updated in January 2018.

\subsection{Organising Data in Multidimensional Arrays}
Scripts in \MATLAB were created to synchronise the data using the clock 
drift and clock offset values which were provided for each of the 
NeMEMSi sensors. Then the data from each sensor is aligned in 
time using using \texttt{finddelay()} and \texttt{alignsignals()} 
in \MATLAB.

%The use of \texttt{alignsignals()} is useful when the data is relatively clean
%that means that when data was noisy the alignment were not even close
%when two signals were quite similar. Therefore, I decided to
%program my own \texttt{alignsignalsMX()} to use the synchronised
%data but with different length.
%Scripts in \R  were used for postprocessing the data.

\subsection{Data Synchornisation}
To find the delay between two two sensors that were attached to the same place
of the body parts, a function called  \texttt{finddelayMX()} was created.
Such function computes the autocorrelation between two signals using 
\texttt(xcorr())
then the maximum value of the autocorrleation function is extracted
to create a delay between the values of maximum index in the autocorrelation
function and the length of the first signal.
% [R, lag] = xcorr(X,Y);
% [Y,I] = max(R);  %%%[Y,I] = max(X) returns the indices of the maximum values in vector I.
% delay = abs(I - length( X ) );

The function \texttt{alignsignalsMX()} was used to align two signals based
on \texttt{finddelayMX()}. The function \texttt{alignsignalsMX()} use six inputs
of which sA and sB are the sensors, then the windowframe of which the information
of the signal is extracted from another activities, the MainAxis of which the
signal are going to be extracted, the truncate delay that is created to
synchronise the signals adding an extra delay that is based on the length of
previous signals and tuning delay that can be useful to tune the delay in the
case of the delay is not appropriate when the signals are too noisy.
% function [a,b,delay] =
% alignsignalsMX(sA,sB,windowframe,MainAxis,truncate_delay, tuning_delay)
Then, it is used the \texttt{aligntwosignals()} to align only two signals.
The inputs of \texttt{aligntwosignals()} are X and Y for the input vectors,
truncate delay for the previous delay of two signals and tunning delay
in case that signals are two noise and the xcorr fail to find an appropriate
delay.
 % function [a,b,delay] = aligntwosignals(X,Y,truncate_delay, tuning_delay)

\subsection{Time Alignment}
%It was taken another approach to align the data in time in which the
%original synchronised data is manipulated. 
Given four vectors of time
$t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4$, it is extracted the minimum and maximum values
of the start of the four sequence of time,
it was also extracted the minimum and maximum values to the
end of the four sequence of time.
However, after aligning the vectors it has then  been noticed that there were
different values of length across vectors i.e.: $1880,1986,1987,1988$
Therefore the length for the second vector was used as the primary length
because is the one that is present the minimum value of the three maximum
lengths. Then \texttt{interp1(x,v,vq,'phchip')}  was used to interpolate the
length of each of the vectors such as the length of all vectors is: 
$1986,1986,1986,1986$.
It has been chosen the \texttt{phchip} since the interpolation present
values for each of the points which were different for the NA values
from what it has been got when using \texttt{linear}.

\subsection{Issues with IMUs} \label{appendix:imus:issues}
For the experiment of human-image imitation activities where eight activities 
were performed per participant, we observed that time synchronisation had 
issues because of the drift in time, also some disconnection because of the 
bluetooth module. In contrast, for the human-humanoid imitation activities
where only four activities were performed by participant, the data collection
of time series did have little issues with regard to the drift in time 
and bluetooth data streaming.

\section{NAO -- humanoid robot}  \label{appendix:nao}
For the human-humanoid interaction experiments of this thesis, 
we used a NAO humanoid robot version 04 from SoftBank (Fig .\ref{fig:nao}).
NAO were programmed for simple horizontal and vertical arm movements
using Choregraphe, an API to program NAO, and then exported interpolated 
values to phython code.
