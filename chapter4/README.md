* [ ] mv to emphaise the use of RQA for human movment varialbiyt
```
RQA has been applied in many fields 
such as life science, engineering, physics, and others \cite{marwan2008}.
Particularly in human movement to investigate noise and complexity of postural control \cite{rhea2011},
postural control \cite{apthorp2014} or interpersonal coordination \cite{duran2017}.

The success of RQA is not only due to its simple algorithmic implementation but also to 
its capacity to detect tiny modulations in frequency or phase 
which are not detectable using standard methods e.g. spectral or wavelet analysis 
\cite{marwan2011}, and that RQA's metrics are quantitatively and qualitatively 
independent of embedding  dimension which is verified experimentally by \cite{iwanski1998}.

%%EXTRA INVESTIGATION FOR RP
%Marwan et al. \cite{marwan2007, marwan2015} reviewed RP algorithm where different criteria  
%for neighbours can be used, as well as norms ( $L_{1-norm}$, $L_{2-norm}$, or $L_{\infty-norm}$ )
%and threshold parameter $\epsilon_i$.
%The threshold $\epsilon_i$ can be selected in different ways.
%It can either be based on a certain percentage of the signal and the amount of noise or 
%using a factor based on the standard deviation of the observational noise among many others \cite{marwan2007}.
%However, Marwan et al. \cite{marwan2007,marwan2015} has concluded 
%that "the choice of $\epsilon$ depends strongly on the system under study" 
%which is an open question for which this research can provide a better 
%understanding of the representation of the recurrence plots.

* [ ] RPs RQAs and its relatinship with other dynamics invariatns such as LyE

%What is interesting is the small-scale texture where short lines parallel to the diagonal 
%of the recurrence plots of which length is related to the inverse of the 
%Largest lyapunov exponent, also it can be noticed a checkerboard texture where, 
%for the case of Lorenz system, $X(i)$ moves on a spiral, sometimes around one,
%sometimes around the other of the two symmetric points of the system /cite{eckmann1987}.

%in terms of window size, the RQA are based on statistical measures
%to which "a minimul lenght that a variation can be considered significant."
%for calculation of dynamic inveariastn such as lyaponuov exponent,
%the lenght also play a crucial role where to guarantee a useful results
%long time series are required.
